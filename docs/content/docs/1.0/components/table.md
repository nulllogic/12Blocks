## Overview

Due to the widespread use of `<table>` elements across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers, 24grid's tables are **opt-in**.

All table styles are not inherited in 24grid, meaning any nested tables can be styled independent from the parent.

{{< table class="table" simplified="false" >}}
