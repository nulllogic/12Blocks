## Example

Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and `em` units. As of v5,
badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

<Snippet lang="html">
    <h1>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h1>
    <h2>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h2>
    <h3>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h3>
    <h4>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h4>
    <h5>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h5>
    <h6>Example heading <span class="badge">New</span></h6>
</Snippet>

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.

<Snippet lang="html">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    Notifications <span class="badge">4</span>
    </button>
</Snippet>


Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive
technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be
presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random
additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.

Unless the context is clear (as with the "Notifications" example, where it is understood that the "4" is the number of
notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.

<Snippet lang="html">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
    Profile <span class="badge">9</span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">unread messages</span>
    </button>
</Snippet>


## Background colors

Use our background utility classes to quickly change the appearance of a badge. Please note that when using xiigrid's
default `.bg-light`, you'll likely need a text color utility like `.text-dark` for proper styling. This is because
background utilities do not set anything but `background-color`.

## Pill badges

Use the `.rounded-pill` utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger `border-radius`.
## Sass
